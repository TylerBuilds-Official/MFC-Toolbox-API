"""
Specialty Tools Package

Contains executor functions for specialty-gated tools.
These tools require specific specialty roles (e.g., drawing_coordinator)
rather than base role levels.

Structure:
- drawing_coordinator/  → Transmittal processing, drawing classification
- estimator/           → (Future) Takeoff tools, estimate reports
- project_manager/     → (Future) PM reports, schedule management
