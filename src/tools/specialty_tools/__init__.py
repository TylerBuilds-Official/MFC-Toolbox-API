"""
Specialty Tools Package

Contains executor functions for specialty-gated tools.
These tools require specific specialty roles (e.g., drawing_coordinator, estimator)
rather than base role levels.

Structure:
- drawing_coordinator/  → Transmittal processing, drawing classification
- estimator/            → PDF plan classification, discipline breakout
- project_manager/      → (Future) PM reports, schedule management
